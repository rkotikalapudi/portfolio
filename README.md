### Publications 
#### Predictive modelling of pain sensitivity using brain information
[Publication](https://journals.lww.com/pain/fulltext/9900/brain_morphology_predicts_individual_sensitivity.323.aspx)
Developed a preditive model on multicenter brain imaging data for predictive individual's pain sensitivity. This model 
serves as a Proof-of-Concept (POS) for brain morphology-based pain predictive models and finds its applications in healthcare towards accute and chronic pain treatments. To know more about the project, [click here].
