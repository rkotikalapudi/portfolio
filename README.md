### Publications 
#### Predictive modelling of pain sensitivity using brain information  
[Link to the publication](https://journals.lww.com/pain/fulltext/9900/brain_morphology_predicts_individual_sensitivity.323.aspx)   

Developed a preditive model on multicenter brain imaging data for predicting individual's pain sensitivity. This model 
serves as a Proof-of-Concept (POS) for brain morphology-based pain predictive models and finds its applications in healthcare towards accute and chronic pain treatments. To know more about the project, [click here](https://github.com/pni-lab/ctp-signature).

#### Brain MRI images can predict individual optimism bias: a psychological phenomenon  
[Link to the publication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9822990/)   

What is optimism bias? Why people in general are optimistic about achieving their goals? Is it possible that there is a neuroimaging driven model that can explain variability in optimism bias at an individual behavioral level? We attempt to address these questions in our scientific article on optimism bias.
